-) to run multiple celery workers, hostnames for each of one must be unique!!!
see: https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/userguide/workers.html#starting-the-worker

rabbitmq distributes tasks to workers, probably using round-robin algorithm


to monitor rabbitmq queues, run bash shell on the container and execute command like below:
$ rabbitmqctl list_queues
